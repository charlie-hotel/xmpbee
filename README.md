# XMPBee 

Warning! This is vibecoded and may be garbage in some areas. I have conducted a security review of the code that the robot spewed out, but I am *not* a swift developer! You should double check before running this also! I will be actively watching this repo and am happy to try to address any flaws.

# Why is this vibecoded? You are lame!
I too am an AI skeptic, so yeah, I realise the irony of putting out a vibecoded app. However, XMPP is basically dead apart from a couple of niche usecases, and the only Mac app that works properly to my knowledge is Adium. Adium hasn't been touched for over a decade now, and looks and acts like hot garbage. I got sick of it one day and asked myself "who is coding an XMPP app in 2026?" and the answer was "not me, and probably not anyone else" so I had a robot do it.

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 or later (26 preferred)
- An XMPP server (Ejabberd, Prosody, Openfire, or any compliant implementation)
- Correct political-ideological orientation toward open protocols

# Build
Open it in xcode and press the button. Am I signing it ever? probably not lol

# Features
- It's a native mac application. It only uses around 80-200mb of RAM.
- Modern macOS UI - native in form, native in spirit
- XMPP only!
- Prioritizes multi-user rooms over DMs, no contact list (you can open a DM and receive DMs though). The contact list is a bourgeois preoccupation.
- Join/part hiding on by default, no spam out of the gate like Adium
- Reconnects smoothly in most cases!
- Custom notification sounds
- Light mode and Dark mode supported
